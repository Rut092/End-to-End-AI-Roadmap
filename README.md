# 🚀 AI & Deep Learning: Path to Excellence
> **Goal:** Transitioning into a high-impact AI Engineer role by mastering Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI from first principles.

This repository serves as a live documentation of my technical growth. Instead of just "running code," I focus on the **under-the-hood math**, **bias-variance tradeoffs**, and **production-ready deployment**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- **Frameworks:** Scikit-Learn, PyTorch (Ongoing)
- **Tools:** Google Colab, GitHub, Docker (Upcoming)
- **Mathematical Focus:** Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics for ML.

## 🧠 The Learning Blueprint
I follow a structured **6-Stage Workflow** for every project to ensure consistency and production quality:
1. **Data Ingestion:** Efficient loading from Drive/Cloud.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns and noise.
3. **Preprocessing:** Feature scaling and handling missing values (Fit vs. Transform logic).
4. **Model Architecture:** Selecting the right algorithm for the problem.
5. **Training & Optimization:** Tuning hyperparameters and loss functions.
6. **Evaluation:** Analyzing Bias vs. Variance to ensure generalization.
